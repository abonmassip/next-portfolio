**Hi! I'm Albert** and after 9 years abroad (in Zurich and Los Angeles), I've returned to Barcelona looking for new opportunities.
\
\
I build dynamic websites with **`React`** and **`Next.js`**, and also 3D web experiences using **`Three.js`**. As backend I use **`Express`** and **`PostgreSQL`**. Previously I was a [3D generalist](https://abonmassip.artstation.com/) and I have advanced skills in **`Photoshop`**, **`Blender`** and the 3D graphics pipeline.
